      process: `"θ = tan⁻¹(n₂/n₁)" This equation is known as Brewster's law, where 'θ' is a brewster's angle, 'n₁' is the refractive index of the first media through which light propagates (the "incidental medium"), and 'n₂' is the index of the other medium, and we can simply get the angle by plugging these numbers into the equation.`,
      details: `The reflected light will be linearly polarised if light strikes an interface at a 90ᴼ angle between the reflected and refracted rays. The polarisation direction (the direction in which the electric field vectors point) is parallel to the interface plane.

               The Brewster angle, θ., is a unique incidence angle that results in a 90ᴼ angle between the reflected and refracted rays. A quick calculation reveals that tan(θ) = n₂/n₁.`,
